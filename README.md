This is a work-in-progress reference tool of common scaled abuse actor goals, incentives, methods, and inversely platform surfaces, policies, interventions, and design considerations. Similar to Security's [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) or [Malpedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/) for focused on online platform safety scaled abuses instead such as toll fraud, infrastructure abuse, spam, harassment, account generation, and scraping.
